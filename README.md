Not all of my ideas are fully set in place just yet, I've created all of this up to this commit in 10 Hours!
This project was really made to create a first NEAT AI neural network, to come up with the best strategies to this game.
The best part is, no one has ever recreated this minigame before! It's all opensource and easy to modify!
And I've never really made any sort of game, all I am is a security researcher.

Have any suggestions or ideas please go to [discussions](https://github.com/beak2825/MarioPipeSlideGame/discussions) or make a pull request with working code.

Completely comes with built-in music and sound FX!
